# Intro to Python Tutorials

Welcome to the Intro to Python Tutorial which is part of Foundations of Computational Social Systems.

This Tutorial is split in three parts. For each part there is a tutorial and a corresponding exercise. The tutorial consists of a Jupyter Notebook containing information about python basics in video, text and code form. The exercises are again Jupyter Notebooks to strenghten the learned theory of the tutorial. We highly recommend you try to solve these exercises by yourself.

The three parts are split up as seen in Table below:
| Day | Tutorial | Exercise |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 18.10 Group A (HS II)<br>20.10 Group B (HS i3) | [Print, Comments, String, Numbers, Datastructures, Booleans and Conditions](./tutorials/tutorial01.ipynb) | [Exercises 1](./exercises/tutorial_exercise_1.ipynb) |
| 25.10 Group A (HS II)<br>27.10 Group B (HS i3) | [Loops, Functions and File I/O](./tutorials/tutorial02.ipynb) | [Exercises 2](./exercises/tutorial_exercise_2.ipynb) |
| 03.11 Group A and Group B (HS II) | [Pandas, matplotlib, networkx and twarc](./tutorials/tutorial03.ipynb) | [Exercises 3](./exercises/tutorial_exercise_3.ipynb) |

Since we only have one hour per week, the idea is that you work through the tutorials and try to solve the exercises and then in class we try to solve them together. There will be a feedbackr link on top of each tutorial exercise where you can tell me if you need more help for the specific exercises, so we can focus on these exercises in class. 
The tutorials should also serve as a reference for the bonus exercises later in the semester.

There is also a [feedbackr](fbr.io/FCSS) open during the whole semester where you can ask questions which we can go through in class. You can also ask questions there during class if you do not want to speak out loud ;)

## Setup
For this course as mentioned you will need Python, [here](https://hackmd.io/@rlcmtzc/HJ0zIApbs) is a link to the tutorial to install Python and Jupyter lab (needed for Jupyter Notebooks). If you struggle to install python and jupyter lab please let me know (write me a mail ;) moritz.erlacher@student.tugraz.at)
