    "\n",
    "While the python standard library is *extensive*, there is an even bigger collection of 3rd-party packages available. `pip` is one of several possibilities to install such additional python packages. It comes with the default python setup, so you can use it right away. Note that pip is a package itself, but is usually used as a command line tool, not within a `.py`-script or `.ipynb`-notebook. You most likely already used pip when installing JupyterLab. Replace `pip` with `pip3` in the following commands, if you are using MACOS or Linux.\n",
    "\n",
    "To install a package with pip, simply open up a terminal and enter\n",
    "> `pip install <package name>`\n",
    "\n",
    "e.g.\n",
    "> `pip install numpy`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple packages can be installed at once by just chaining names (separated with spaces) like this:\n",
    "> `pip install numpy matplotlib pandas scipy`\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on your computer's settings and environment setup, you might run into permission issues. Usually installing new packages just for the current user (instead of the systemwide default) fixes those:\n",
    "> `pip install --user numpy`\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like python itself, its packages exist in different versions, having different features and dependencies. This often leads to issues when trying to run code one another computer. Best practice would be to create a *virtual environment* ([Docs](https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/installing-packages/#creating-virtual-environments)) for each project, using *requirements files* ([Docs](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/user_guide/#requirements-files)) - or using Docker containers. You are welcome to do so, but for now it's sufficient to just install packages globally ;)\n",
