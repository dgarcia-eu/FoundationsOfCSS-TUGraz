# Echo chambers vs filter bubbles

Early definitions of the filter bubble focused on search results and personalization but not on polarized social structures (algorithmic definition). </br>
[The filter bubble: What the Internet is hiding from you. Eli Pariser (2011)](https://www.amazon.de/Filter-Bubble-What-Internet-Hiding/dp/1594203008)

Axel Bruns's definitions to distinguish echo chambers from filter bubbles:

- An **echo chamber** comes into being where a group of participants choose to preferentially connect with
each other, to the exclusion of outsiders.
- A **filter bubble** emerges when a group of participants, independent of the underlying network
structures of their connections with others, choose to preferentially communicate with each other, to
the exclusion of outsiders.

# Does social media create polarization?

The role of social media is not the same in all conflicts. 

The question "does social media create polarization?" implies an oversimplification of the problem:
- use of social media (e.g. Facebook vs Twitter)
- the definition of polarization (e.g. affective vs opinions)
- the social context of polarized societies (e.g. partisan vs ethnic).

The issue of polarization is an example of why we need precise and robust definitions, why we need research on many different platforms, and why we need no-WEIRD (Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich and Democratic) populations in research.
