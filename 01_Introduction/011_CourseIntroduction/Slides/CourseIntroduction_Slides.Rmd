# Course objectives

1. Learning the fundamentals of computational methods and data science to study **human behavior** and technological phenomena in the digital society. 

2. To understand methodological **opportunities and limitations**, as well as how to apply these methods in practical sessions.

3. How to plan, execute, and reflect on the **empirical analysis** of digital trace data to address questions about human behavior and emergent technological phenomena. 

4. Special emphasis on an **interdisciplinary approach** that can inform students from various disciplines.

# Projects information

The assessment for the course is based on the final group research project.
Groups can have at most 4 students and must mix students with different backgrounds.

- Empirical analysis project: data retrieval, processing, analysis, and interpretation. 

- Research questions are very important! (more about that later)

- Can be linked to project in Introduction to CSS. Great opportunity to start working together on a follow-up project in the programme

- We will post project ideas, you can pick from those, reproduce a previous paper, or bring your own idea.

# Course assessment

- The **group** project grade is a combination:
  - ten-minute presentation (50%)
  - six-page written report on the project (50%).

- **Individual** extra points (max 20%) can be achieved by delivering solutions to optional exercises
  - Each exercise is worth 5%
  - Grade is pass/fail
  - Feedback on solutions will be available in practice tutorials

- Lecture+Exercises (VU): projects are mandatory

- **Questions?**
